    All phones lobbed stream their movement in real time to our servers. Therefore, you and your friends, anywhere in the world, can watch your phone rocket through the sky live.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before you <a href="/lob">throw your phone</a>, you will see a Lob Code such <b>XD8CA</b> appear at the top of the page. You will need that code to watch a live lob.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Lob Code for each phone being lobbed is unique. On the <a href="/#watch">home page</a>, under "Watch a phone get lobbed", you can enter the code from the phone and watch the phone from anywhere in the world get its wings.
